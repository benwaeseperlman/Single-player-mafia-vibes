# Unit Testing After Implementation Steps

After completing the implementation of a step outlined in the [implementation-plan.md](mdc:memory-bank/implementation-plan.md), immediately proceed to create comprehensive unit tests for the newly added or modified code.

Ensure tests cover:
- Core functionality
- Edge cases
- Error handling

Reference the relevant service files (e.g., [game_manager.py](mdc:llm-mafia/backend/app/services/game_manager.py)) and models when writing tests.
