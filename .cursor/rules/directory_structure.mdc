# Project Directory Structure

**IMPORTANT:** All source code, tests, configuration files (like Dockerfiles, `.env` templates), and related assets **MUST** reside within the `llm-mafia` directory.

The root workspace directory should only contain:
* The `llm-mafia` project folder.
* Top-level git files (e.g., `.gitignore`).

The `memory-bank` directory is **strictly** for documentation and progress tracking, *not* for functional code or assets.

Refer to [architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/architecture.md) for the detailed structure breakdown within `llm-mafia`.
