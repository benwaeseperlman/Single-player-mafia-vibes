The chosen technology stack for the LLM Mafia project is outlined in [tech-stack.md](mdc:tech-stack.md).

This includes:
*   Frontend: React
*   Backend: Python + FastAPI
*   Real-time: WebSockets
*   LLM Integration: Provider's Python Client
*   State Management: In-Memory / File-based (initially)

Refer to this document for details on the project's technical implementation.

Remember to leverage the chosen technologies (e.g., React components, FastAPI routers) to create modular code and avoid monolithic files.
