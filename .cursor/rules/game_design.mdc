# Game Design Document

The core concept, mechanics, roles, phases, AI requirements, and UI/UX for the LLM Mafia game are detailed in the Game Design Document: [game_design_document.md](mdc:game_design_document.md).

Refer to this document for questions about how the game should function.

When implementing features based on this design, prioritize modular code organization and avoid creating monolithic files.
