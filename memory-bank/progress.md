# Project Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Backend Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure (2025-04-27)

- [x] Created root directory (`llm-mafia`)
- [x] Created subdirectories:
  - [x] `backend/` (for FastAPI application)
  - [x] `backend/app/core/` (for core logic and config)
  - [x] `backend/app/models/` (for Pydantic data models)
  - [x] `backend/app/api/` (for API endpoint routers)
  - [x] `backend/app/services/` (for business logic services)
  - [x] `backend/data/` (for storing serialized game states)
  - [x] `frontend/` (for React application)
  - [x] ~~`docs/` (for design/plan documents)~~ - Removed as documents are already in memory-bank
- [x] Created basic `README.md` at the root
- [x] ~~Copied design documents to `docs/` directory~~ - Skipped as documents are already in memory-bank

All directories have been successfully created with the intended structure as per the implementation plan. The README.md provides a basic overview of the project for future developers and users.

### Step 2: Setup Backend (FastAPI) (2025-04-27)

- [x] Set up a Python virtual environment (`venv`)
- [x] Installed core dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `pydantic`, `websockets`
- [x] Created basic FastAPI app in `backend/app/main.py` with a health check endpoint
- [x] Created `backend/app/core/config.py` with settings loaded from environment variables
- [x] Created empty `__init__.py` files in all directories
- [x] Created `.gitignore` file to exclude environment files and data
- [x] Created `requirements.txt` file with dependencies
- [x] Verified backend is working by running the server and testing health endpoint

The backend server is now set up with a basic FastAPI application structure and a working health check endpoint. Configuration is managed through environment variables and the application is ready for implementing the core game models and logic.

### Step 3: Define Core Game Models (2025-04-27)

- [x] Created `player.py`: Defined `Role` (Enum: MAFIA, DETECTIVE, DOCTOR, VILLAGER), `PlayerStatus` (Enum: ALIVE, DEAD), `Player` model (id, name, role, status, is_human, persona_id)
- [x] Created `game.py`: Defined `GamePhase` (Enum: NIGHT, DAY, PREGAME, GAMEOVER), `GameState` model (game_id, players, phase, day_number, settings, history, etc.)
- [x] Created `settings.py`: Defined `GameSettings` model (player_count, role_distribution, etc.) with validators for game rule enforcement
- [x] Created `actions.py`: Defined models for night actions (`MafiaKillAction`, `DetectiveInvestigateAction`, `DoctorProtectAction`) and voting (`VoteAction`) along with a `ChatMessage` model
- [x] Created `persona.py`: Defined `AIPersona` model with personality traits and behavioral characteristics
- [x] Created `memory.py`: Defined `AIMemory` model to store each AI agent's recollection of game events
- [x] Updated `models/__init__.py` to export all models for easier importing

All core game models have been implemented using Pydantic for data validation and serialization. The models are structured to support the full game mechanics as specified in the Game Design Document, including role-specific actions, game phases, player management, and AI persona/memory.

### Step 4: Implement State Persistence Service (Current Date - replace with actual date)

- [x] Created `backend/app/services/state_service.py`
- [x] Implemented `save_game_state` function using JSON serialization (Pydantic model_dump_json) to save `GameState` to `backend/data/game_{game_id}.json`.
- [x] Implemented `load_game_state` function to load `GameState` from JSON file (Pydantic model_validate).
- [x] Implemented `delete_game_state` function to remove game state files.
- [x] Added basic error handling for file I/O and JSON operations.

State persistence service is implemented using file-based JSON storage. It handles saving, loading, and deleting game state based on `game_id`. Ready for testing and integration.

### Next Steps
- Step 5: Implement Game Manager Service (Handles game creation, player joining) - *Pending validation of Step 4*
- Step 6: Implement Basic Game API Endpoints
