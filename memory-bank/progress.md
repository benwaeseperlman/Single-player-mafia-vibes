# Project Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Backend Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure (2025-04-27)

- [x] Created root directory (`llm-mafia`)
- [x] Created subdirectories:
  - [x] `backend/` (for FastAPI application)
  - [x] `backend/app/core/` (for core logic and config)
  - [x] `backend/app/models/` (for Pydantic data models)
  - [x] `backend/app/api/` (for API endpoint routers)
  - [x] `backend/app/services/` (for business logic services)
  - [x] `backend/data/` (for storing serialized game states)
  - [x] `frontend/` (for React application)
  - [x] ~~`docs/` (for design/plan documents)~~ - Removed as documents are already in memory-bank
- [x] Created basic `README.md` at the root
- [x] ~~Copied design documents to `docs/` directory~~ - Skipped as documents are already in memory-bank

All directories have been successfully created within `llm-mafia` with the intended structure as per the implementation plan. The README.md provides a basic overview of the project for future developers and users.
*Unit tests written and passed.*

### Step 2: Setup Backend (FastAPI) (2025-04-27)

- [x] Set up a Python virtual environment (`venv`) within `llm-mafia/backend`
- [x] Installed core dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `pydantic`, `websockets`
- [x] Created basic FastAPI app in `llm-mafia/backend/app/main.py` with a health check endpoint
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/core/config.py` with settings loaded from environment variables
- [x] Created empty `__init__.py` files in all relevant directories within `llm-mafia/backend/app`
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/.gitignore` file to exclude environment files and data
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/requirements.txt` file with dependencies
- [x] Verified backend is working by running the server and testing health endpoint

The backend server is now set up within `llm-mafia/backend` with a basic FastAPI application structure and a working health check endpoint. Configuration is managed through environment variables and the application is ready for implementing the core game models and logic.
*Unit tests written and passed.*

### Step 3: Define Core Game Models (2025-04-27)

- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/player.py`: Defined `Role`, `PlayerStatus`, `Player` model
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/game.py`: Defined `GamePhase`, `GameState` model
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/settings.py`: Defined `GameSettings` model
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/actions.py`: Defined action and message models
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/persona.py`: Defined `AIPersona` model
- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/memory.py`: Defined `AIMemory` model
- [x] Updated `llm-mafia/backend/app/models/__init__.py` to export all models

All core game models have been implemented using Pydantic within `llm-mafia/backend/app/models`. The models are structured to support the full game mechanics.
*Unit tests written and passed.*

### Step 4: Implement State Persistence Service (Current Date - replace with actual date)

- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/services/state_service.py`
- [x] Implemented `save_game_state` function using JSON serialization to save `GameState` to `llm-mafia/backend/data/game_{game_id}.json`.
- [x] Implemented `load_game_state` function to load `GameState` from JSON file.
- [x] Implemented `delete_game_state` function to remove game state files.
- [x] Added basic error handling for file I/O and JSON operations.

State persistence service is implemented within `llm-mafia/backend/app/services` using file-based JSON storage in `llm-mafia/backend/data`. It handles saving, loading, and deleting game state based on `game_id`.
*Unit tests written and passed.*

### Step 5: Implement Game Management Service (Current Date - replace with actual date)

- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/services/game_manager.py`
- [x] Implemented `GameManager` class to handle game lifecycle.
- [x] Implemented in-memory cache (`active_games`) for active `GameState` objects, using UUIDs as keys.
- [x] Implemented `create_game` method:
    - Generates unique `game_id` (string).
    - Initializes `Player` list based on `GameSettings`.
    - Assigns roles randomly (ensuring one human player).
    - Creates initial `GameState`, storing `settings.id` in `settings_id`.
    - Persists state via `state_service.save_game_state` (passing UUID game_id).
    - Adds game to cache (using UUID game_id).
- [x] Implemented `get_game` method (accepts string ID, uses UUID internally for cache/state_service).
- [x] Implemented `update_game_state` method (accepts string ID, uses UUID internally for cache/state_service).
- [x] Implemented `remove_game_from_cache` method (accepts string ID, uses UUID internally for cache).
- [x] Included basic error handling and logging for invalid UUIDs and operations.
- [x] Added `llm-mafia/backend/setup.py` and installed package in editable mode to aid testing.
- [x] Created unit tests (`llm-mafia/backend/tests/test_game_manager.py`).
- [x] Debugged and fixed import errors (using `sys.path` modification in tests), Pydantic validation errors (`persona_id`), and `UUID` vs `str` inconsistencies.

The `GameManager` service is implemented and unit tested. It provides core logic for creating new games, managing player lists with role assignments, retrieving game states (from cache or storage), and updating/persisting game states, ensuring consistent use of UUIDs internally. Testing setup required adding `setup.py` and modifying `sys.path` in tests.
*Unit tests written and passed.*

### Step 6: Setup Initial API Endpoint (Current Date - replace with actual date)

- [x] Created `llm-mafia/backend/app/api/game_endpoints.py` with FastAPI router.
- [x] Implemented `POST /api/game` endpoint to create a game using `GameManager`.
- [x] Implemented `GET /api/game/{game_id}` endpoint to retrieve game state using `GameManager`.
- [x] Implemented `GET /api/games` endpoint to list saved games using `state_service`.
- [x] Included the `game_endpoints` router in `llm-mafia/backend/app/main.py`.
- [x] Refactored to use a global `GameManager` instance.
- [x] Added `httpx` dependency for testing.
- [x] Created unit tests (`llm-mafia/backend/tests/test_game_endpoints.py`) covering endpoints.

Initial API endpoints for basic game management (create, get, list) are implemented and integrated into the main FastAPI application. Basic error handling (400, 404, 500) is included.
*Unit tests written and passed.*

### Next Steps
- Step 7: Implement Phase Logic (`llm-mafia/backend/app/services/phase_logic.py`) - *Not Started*
