# Project Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Backend Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure (2025-04-27)

- [x] Created root directory (`llm-mafia`)
- [x] Created subdirectories:
  - [x] `backend/` (for FastAPI application)
  - [x] `backend/app/core/` (for core logic and config)
  - [x] `backend/app/models/` (for Pydantic data models)
  - [x] `backend/app/api/` (for API endpoint routers)
  - [x] `backend/app/services/` (for business logic services)
  - [x] `backend/data/` (for storing serialized game states)
  - [x] `frontend/` (for React application)
  - [x] ~~`docs/` (for design/plan documents)~~ - Removed as documents are already in memory-bank
- [x] Created basic `README.md` at the root
- [x] ~~Copied design documents to `docs/` directory~~ - Skipped as documents are already in memory-bank

All directories have been successfully created with the intended structure as per the implementation plan. The README.md provides a basic overview of the project for future developers and users.

### Next Steps
- Step 2: Setup Backend (FastAPI) - Pending validation
