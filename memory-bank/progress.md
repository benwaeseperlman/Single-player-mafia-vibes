# Project Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Backend Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure (2025-04-27)

- [x] Created root directory (`llm-mafia`)
- [x] Created subdirectories:
  - [x] `backend/` (for FastAPI application)
  - [x] `backend/app/core/` (for core logic and config)
  - [x] `backend/app/models/` (for Pydantic data models)
  - [x] `backend/app/api/` (for API endpoint routers)
  - [x] `backend/app/services/` (for business logic services)
  - [x] `backend/data/` (for storing serialized game states)
  - [x] `frontend/` (for React application)
  - [x] ~~`docs/` (for design/plan documents)~~ - Removed as documents are already in memory-bank
- [x] Created basic `README.md` at the root
- [x] ~~Copied design documents to `docs/` directory~~ - Skipped as documents are already in memory-bank

All directories have been successfully created with the intended structure as per the implementation plan. The README.md provides a basic overview of the project for future developers and users.

### Step 2: Setup Backend (FastAPI) (2025-04-27)

- [x] Set up a Python virtual environment (`venv`)
- [x] Installed core dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `pydantic`, `websockets`
- [x] Created basic FastAPI app in `backend/app/main.py` with a health check endpoint
- [x] Created `backend/app/core/config.py` with settings loaded from environment variables
- [x] Created empty `__init__.py` files in all directories
- [x] Created `.gitignore` file to exclude environment files and data
- [x] Created `requirements.txt` file with dependencies
- [x] Verified backend is working by running the server and testing health endpoint

The backend server is now set up with a basic FastAPI application structure and a working health check endpoint. Configuration is managed through environment variables and the application is ready for implementing the core game models and logic.

### Next Steps
- Step 3: Define Core Game Models - Pending validation
